usage: |-
  This module is meant to be used as output only, meaning it will be used to create outputs which are consumed as a parameter by Terraform resources or other modules.

  Caution: This module, unlike nearly all other Cloud Posse Terraform modules, does not use [terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/).
  Furthermore, it has an input named `environment` which has a completely different meaning than the one in `terraform-null-label`.
  Do not call this module with the conventional `context = module.this.context`. See the documentation below for the usage of `environment`.

  For complete examples, see

  - [multi-port mappings](examples/multi_port_mappings)
  - [multi-type env vars](examples/multi_type_env_vars)
  - [multiple definitions](examples/multiple_definitions)
  - [string env vars](examples/string_env_vars)

  For a complete example with automated tests, see [examples/complete](examples/complete) with `bats` and `Terratest` for the example [test](test).
