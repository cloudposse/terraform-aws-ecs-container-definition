# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to generate well-formed JSON documents that are passed to the `aws_ecs_task_definition` Terraform resource as [container definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definitions).

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  This module is meant to be used as output only, meaning it will be used to create outputs which are consumed as a parameter by Terraform resources or other modules.
