# terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-container-definition/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to generate well-formed JSON documents that are passed to the `aws_ecs_task_definition` Terraform resource as [container definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definitions).

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage

This module is meant to be used as output only, meaning it will be used to create outputs which are consumed as a parameter by Terraform resources or other modules.

For complete examples, see

- [multi-port mappings](examples/multi_port_mappings)
- [multi-type env vars](examples/multi_type_env_vars)
- [multiple definitions](examples/multiple_definitions)
- [string env vars](examples/string_env_vars)






## Makefile Targets
```
Available targets:

  help                                Help screen
  help/all                            Display help for all targets
  help/short                          This help short screen

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| command | The command that is passed to the container | list | `<list>` | no |
| container_cpu | The number of cpu units to reserve for the container. This is optional for tasks using Fargate launch type and the total amount of container_cpu of all containers in a task will need to be lower than the task-level cpu value | string | `256` | no |
| container_image | The image used to start the container. Images in the Docker Hub registry available by default | string | - | yes |
| container_memory | The amount of memory (in MiB) to allow the container to use. This is a hard limit, if the container attempts to exceed the container_memory, the container is killed. This field is optional for Fargate launch type and the total amount of container_memory of all containers in a task will need to be lower than the task memory value | string | `256` | no |
| container_memory_reservation | The amount of memory (in MiB) to reserve for the container. If container needs to exceed this threshold, it can do so up to the set container_memory hard limit | string | `128` | no |
| container_name | The name of the container. Up to 255 characters ([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], -, _ allowed) | string | - | yes |
| dns_servers | Container DNS servers. This is a list of strings specifying the IP addresses of the DNS servers. | list | `<list>` | no |
| entrypoint | The entry point that is passed to the container | list | `<list>` | no |
| environment | The environment variables to pass to the container. This is a list of maps | list | `<list>` | no |
| essential | Determines whether all other containers in a task are stopped, if this container fails or stops for any reason. Due to how Terraform type casts booleans in json it is required to double quote this value | string | `true` | no |
| healthcheck | A map containing command (string), interval (duration in seconds), retries (1-10, number of times to retry before marking container unhealthy, and startPeriod (0-300, optional grace period to wait, in seconds, before failed healthchecks count toward retries) | map | `<map>` | no |
| log_driver | The log driver to use for the container. If using Fargate launch type, only supported value is awslogs | string | `awslogs` | no |
| log_options | The configuration options to send to the `log_driver` | map | `<map>` | no |
| mount_points | Container mount points. This is a list of maps, where each map should contain a `containerPath` and `sourceVolume` | list | `<list>` | no |
| port_mappings | The port mappings to configure for the container. This is a list of maps. Each map should contain "containerPort", "hostPort", and "protocol", where "protocol" is one of "tcp" or "udp". If using containers in a task with the awsvpc or host network mode, the hostPort can either be left blank or set to the same value as the containerPort | list | `<list>` | no |
| readonly_root_filesystem | Determines whether a container is given read-only access to its root filesystem. Due to how Terraform type casts booleans in json it is required to double quote this value | string | `false` | no |
| repository_credentials | Container repository credentials; required when using a private repo.  This map currently supports a single key; "credentialsParameter", which should be the ARN of a Secrets Manager's secret holding the credentials | map | `<map>` | no |
| secrets | The secrets to pass to the container. This is a list of maps | list | `<list>` | no |
| ulimits | Container ulimit settings. This is a list of maps, where each map should contain "name", "hardLimit" and "softLimit" | list | `<list>` | no |
| working_directory | The working directory to run commands inside the container | string | `` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| json | JSON encoded container definitions for use with other terraform resources such as aws_ecs_task_definition. |
| json_map | JSON encoded container definitions for use with other terraform resources such as aws_ecs_task_definition. |
