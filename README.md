Terraform module to generate well-formed JSON documents that are passed to the `aws_ecs_task_definition` Terraform resource as [container definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definitions).


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Usage

This module is meant to be used as output only, meaning it will be used to create outputs which are consumed as a parameter by Terraform resources or other modules.

Caution: This module, unlike nearly all other Cloud Posse Terraform modules, does not use [terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/).
Furthermore, it has an input named `environment` which has a completely different meaning than the one in `terraform-null-label`.
Do not call this module with the conventional `context = module.this.context`. See the documentation below for the usage of `environment`.

For complete examples, see

- [multi-port mappings](examples/multi_port_mappings)
- [multi-type env vars](examples/multi_type_env_vars)
- [multiple definitions](examples/multiple_definitions)
- [string env vars](examples/string_env_vars)

For a complete example with automated tests, see [examples/complete](examples/complete) with `bats` and `Terratest` for the example [test](test).

```hcl
module "container_definition" {
  source = "cloudposse/ecs-container-definition/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"

  container_name  = "geodesic"
  container_image = "cloudposse/geodesic"
}
```

The output of this module can then be used with one of our other modules.

```hcl
module "ecs_alb_service_task" {
  source = "cloudposse/ecs-alb-service-task/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"

  # ...
  container_definition_json = module.container_definition.json_map_encoded_list
  # ...
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
