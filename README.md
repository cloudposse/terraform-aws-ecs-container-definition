[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


This module is meant to be used as output only, meaning it will be used to create outputs which are consumed as a parameter by Terraform resources or other modules.

For complete examples, see

- [multi-port mappings](examples/multi_port_mappings)
- [multi-type env vars](examples/multi_type_env_vars)
- [multiple definitions](examples/multiple_definitions)
- [string env vars](examples/string_env_vars)

For a complete example with automated tests, see [examples/complete](examples/complete) with `bats` and `Terratest` for the example [test](test).

| container\_cpu | The number of cpu units to reserve for the container. This is optional for tasks using Fargate launch type and the total amount of container\_cpu of all containers in a task will need to be lower than the task-level cpu value | `number` | `0` | no |
| container\_definition | Container definition overrides which allows for extra keys or overriding existing keys. | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |
| container\_depends\_on | The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container can contain multiple dependencies. When a dependency is defined for container startup, for container shutdown it is reversed.

| extra\_hosts | A list of hostnames and IP address mappings to append to the /etc/hosts file on the container. This is a list of maps | <pre>list(object({<br>    ipAddress = string<br>    hostname  = string<br>  }))</pre> | `null` | no |
